        "## Question 10: Imagine you are working at an e-commerce company that wants to predict which customers will respond to a marketing campaign. Given an imbalanced dataset (only 5% of customers respond), describe the approach you’d take to build a Logistic Regression model — including data handling, feature scaling, balancing classes, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the model for this real-world business use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: 1. Understand the Data\n",
        "\n",
        "* Identify features (e.g., age, purchase history, browsing time) and the target (responded: 0/1).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Check for missing values and handle them (impute or remove).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Explore data distribution, especially the imbalance: only 5% respond.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Feature Scaling\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to scale numeric features.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Scaling helps Logistic Regression perform better because it depends on weights of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Handle Class Imbalance\n",
        "\n",
        "* Since only 5% respond, the dataset is heavily imbalanced.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Techniques to handle this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Resampling:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Oversample minority class (e.g., SMOTE) or undersample majority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Class weights:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * In Logistic Regression, set class_weight='balanced' to give more importance to minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Split Data\n",
        "\n",
        "* Split into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Consider stratified split to preserve class distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Train Logistic Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use L2 regularization (default) to avoid overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Include class weights to handle imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Fit the model on scaled training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to tune:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * C (regularization strength)\n",
        "\n",
        "   * penalty (L1 or L2)\n",
        "\n",
        "   * solver\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use cross-validation to avoid overfitting and select the best model.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Model Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "* Accuracy is not enough for imbalanced data. Use metrics like:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Precision: How many predicted responders actually responded.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Recall (Sensitivity): How many actual responders were correctly predicted.\n",
        "\n",
        "* F1-score: Balance between precision and recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "* ROC-AUC: Overall ability to distinguish responders vs non-responders.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use confusion matrix to visualize correct and incorrect predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Real-world Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "* High recall might be important to capture as many potential customers as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "* High precision reduces wasted marketing cost by avoiding false positives.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Monitor the model on new campaigns and retrain periodically with updated data.\n"
